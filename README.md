VBA Challenge

OVERVIEW
The purpose of this challenge is to edit or refactor the code, previously written for Steve. Refactoring the code will allow for it to run in a more efficient manner. While the original code was functional, if the data set increased in size, it would become more difficult to run. In order to streamline the process of analyzing any additional data in the future, itâ€™s best to have the refactored version of the code.

SUMMARY

As evidenced by our report, refactoring the original code written for Steve, allowed for the macro function to be run more efficiently. It was able to deliver the same results at a much quicker pace and involving less lines of code. One advantage of refactoring code is that it is much easier to navigate in order to make any changes or updates in the future. A disadvantage of refactoring code is that, if done incorrectly, it could introduce new bugs or issues into the code.
